Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth
counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by
five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is
eliminated from the game.
